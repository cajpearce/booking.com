# booking.com

When searching for a hotel, I have a few stringent criterias:

1. It must be highly rated for the area
2. It must have enough aggregator reviews to be reliable
3. It must be reasonably priced for the number of stars it has

Using booking.com we can see all this information, but when viewing only 15 hotels per page it can be difficult to accurately capture whether a hotel satisfies these 3 criteria when compared to other hotels.
